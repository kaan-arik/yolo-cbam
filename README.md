# YOLOv8 + CBAM Integration

This repository demonstrates how to integrate **CBAM** (Convolutional Block Attention Module) into Ultralytics‚Äô YOLOv8 instance-segmentation model. It logs which layers are wrapped with CBAM both at integration time and during each forward pass.

## üìñ Project Overview

- **Goal**  
  Enhance YOLOv8‚Äôs `C2f` blocks with channel and spatial attention to help the model focus on more informative features.

- **How It Works**  
  1. Recursively scan the YOLOv8 model for every `C2f` block.  
  2. For each `C2f`, read its output channel count and create a matching CBAM module.  
  3. Replace the original `C2f` with an `nn.Sequential(C2f, CBAM)` wrapper.  
  4. Print log messages:  
     - At integration:  
       ```  
       ‚úÖ CBAM added: C2f @ <module_path>, channels=<N>  
       ```  
     - At each forward call during training:  
       ```  
       ‚úÖ CBAM forward triggered  
       ```

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Automatic Detection**  
  All `C2f` blocks are located and wrapped with CBAM without manual layer indexing.

- **Real-Time Logging**  
  Clearly see which layers receive attention modules and when they execute.

- **Plug-and-Play**  
  Easily drop into any YOLOv8-segmentation training pipeline.
